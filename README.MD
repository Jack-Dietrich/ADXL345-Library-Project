<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Starting this project, I learned the basics of SPI communication (MISO, MOSI, SS,CLK) and wrote basic functions in order to power on the device and initate readings. Along the way, I used both a logic analyser and oscilliscope to debug my program. Next I worked on implementing more functionality of the adxl345 such as chanign data rate, tap detection, and interrupt handling. Next, I hope to convert the project to freeRTOS and C in order to more easily handle interrupts and bring my code closer to code seen in production.</p>
